    <h2>Music career</h2>

    <p>Lady Gaga's music is a fusion of genres, emotions, and creativity that has continuously redefined pop culture.
        From her debut to her most recent works, her songs reflect not just her extraordinary talent but also her
        unshakable belief in individuality, love, and freedom.</h3>
        <br><br>

    <h2>A Journey Through Genres</h2>
    <p>Lady Gaga's music seamlessly blends <i>pop, dance, rock, jazz</i>, and even <i>country</i>. Her debut album,
        <b><i>The Fame</i></b>,
        introduced infectious dance tracks like <i>Just Dance</i> and <i>Poker Face</i>, which became global sensations.
        By her
        second album, <b><i>The Fame Monster</i></b>, she had already begun to explore darker, edgier themes in songs
        like <i>Bad
            Romance</i> and <i>Alejandro</i>
    </p>
    <p>With <b><i>Born This Way</i></b>, she delivered anthems of empowerment, combining electronic beats with rock
        influences.
        Her experimentation continued with <b><i>Joanne</i></b>, where she stripped down her sound to focus on country
        and
        acoustic tones, as seen in Million Reasons.</p>
    <br><br>

    <h2>Storytelling Through Lyrics</h2>
    <p>Gaga's lyrics often carry deep personal and social messages. Born This Way became an anthem for self-love and
        acceptance, particularly within the LGBTQ+ community. Songs like Shallow and Always Remember Us This Way from A
        Star Is Born showcased her storytelling ability, earning her an Oscar for Best Original Song
